 ## Tasks.

   You are creating an app called FanBase. You will show information about your favorite movies and actors.

  1. Create a table view where the header of each section is the name of one of your favorite movies
  2. Therefore each section will only have one row
  3. In that row you will show a horizontal collection view showing the name and image of the top 5 actors in the movie
  4. Tapping the actor's image will load a details screen that shows that same picture of the actor plus information about them
  5. The end result is tableview that can scroll up and down but that also has cells that can scroll from left to right
